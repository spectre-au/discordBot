# Privacy Policy â€” n8nBot

**Last Updated:** [Insert Date]

This Privacy Policy explains how **n8nBot** ("the Bot"), developed and maintained by **Anshul Chauhan** ("Bot Owner"), handles user data during its operation on Discord servers.

n8nBot is currently used for **testing and internal purposes only** and is not intended for public or production deployment.

---

## 1. Data Collection

n8nBot **does not intentionally collect, store, or share** any personal user data.

However, in the process of responding to commands or operating within a Discord server, the Bot may receive and temporarily process the following:

- Usernames and user IDs (as part of Discord messages or commands)
- Message content (only as needed to respond)
- Server/channel identifiers
- Interaction metadata (e.g. command use, timestamps)

This data is **processed in-memory only** and is **not logged or stored** unless explicitly required for temporary debugging.

---

## 2. Data Storage

As of now, **no user data is stored persistently**.

Any logging for testing/debugging is:
- Minimal
- Temporary
- Local (not uploaded or transmitted externally)
- Deleted after testing is complete

---

## 3. Data Sharing

n8nBot **does not share any data** with third parties.

All processing happens within the bot instance, hosted and controlled by the Bot Owner. There is no external API usage (unless explicitly documented for future features).

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

This bot may interact with Discord's API to function, and thus is subject to [Discord's Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

The bot does not integrate with any other third-party services unless explicitly noted in the code or documentation.

---

## 5. Security

While this bot is only used in a private/testing environment, reasonable precautions are taken to secure the environment in which it runs. However, **no security auditing or formal compliance** is performed.

---

## 6. User Rights

Since this bot is used for private testing and does not retain any personal data, no user data exists to access, modify, or delete.

If you believe data is being improperly stored or processed, please contact the Bot Owner directly.

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated occasionally to reflect any changes in how the Bot operates. Significant changes will be noted in the bot's repository.
